# Invasive Species Finder Usability Evaluation Design

## Introduction

This document describes the usability evaluation design for the Invasive Species Finder app. 
The purpose of this usability evaluation is to identify usability problems in the app and 
to collect feedback from users to improve the app. The usability evaluation will be conducted by the developers of the app. 
The usability evaluation will be conducted in the form of a think-aloud test. 
The participants will be asked to complete a series of tasks while thinking aloud. 
The developers will observe the participants and take notes.

## User Goals

The user goals of the Invasive Species Finder app are to:
1. test if the forum and post will satisfy the user's need to share their knowledge about invasive species.

identify the species by AI or ask experts to identify the species.

## Results

1. They all mentioned about the adding post is not very friendly.
Such as not a dropdown list for the category. All fields are single line text field (especially for content should be bigger field).
2. The camera is able to take picture, but not able to upload the picture to the post.
3. The forum is able to show the posts, but posts are not clickable to show the details, also would be nice people can comment on the post.
4. It would be great to have the map to show the location of the invasive species.
