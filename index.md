## Motivation
Hawaiian ecosystems are under high level of threat from numerous invasive
species from all over the world. Invasive species are a major threat to endangered species and native ecosystems. They compete with native species for resources, and can even prey on native species directly. Invasive species can also introduce new diseases to
the island and cause serious damage to the ecosystem or human beings.

## Goals
1. Geotagged photos of invasive species are collected from the public to pinpoint the location.
2. users share photos to check if a species is invasive or not either by the AI or experts.
3. create a community of people who are interested in finding and cleaning up invasive species.
